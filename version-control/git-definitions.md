# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? (it let's other developers working on the same project know who changed what and when they changed it) --- Why is it useful?  (it's important because if there's any error in the midst of the project, developers can revert back to old version and correct the issue much quicker) --
* What is a branch and why would you use one? (a branch is a copy of the master so developers can work on the changes and upload back to the master)
* What is a commit? (commit is when you are done with all changes and uploading your additions or corrections back to the master file) What makes a good commit message?  (a good commit message is a very descriptive one where others can know exactly what was changed on your branched out version)
* What is a merge conflict? (a merge conflict usually occurs when 2 person modifies the same line of code with different data.)
