	<h2>The bad thing about fantasy football</h2>
	<p>Fantasy Football can be addictive. In an article by NY Times, a cautionary tale is told. “Bob” racked up $150,000 USD in debt and lost his family due to fantasy football. Also, the state of Nevada has recently deemed daily fantasy football, played on sites such as FanDuel and and DraftKings, gambling. Nevada is demanding these companies to get a gambling license in order to be legal in the state. However, in a recent video by Frontline PBS, Matt King, CFO of FanDuel, and Bryce Mauro, a user of FanDuel, says it is not a gambling site, but an entertainment product or something similar to the stock market.</p>

<!--i think semantic tags are suppose to give the coding a meaningful way to read the program -->
<!--i think the useful ones are table, form, nav, header and footer  -->
<!--the browsers go from top to bottom when displaying content   -->
<!-- Yes, I think I can create more handy snippets later  -->
<!-- I think understanding when to use which tag and the purpose of the is difficult for me. ie, when to use aside, aticle, or section  -->
