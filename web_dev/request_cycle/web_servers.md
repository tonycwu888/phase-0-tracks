<h2>Linux operating system philosophies</h2>

The key design philosophies of the Linux operating system is derived from the unix philosophy.  Its concepts is of an Egalitarian.  Everyone is given equal power to perform whatever task they wish to perform whether good or bad.  It is total opposite of the windows concepts which is hiding everything behind the GUI.  Linux assumes you are competent and know how everything works and will not hold your hand.  To sum things up, Linux primary philosophy is probably for everyone to treat others with respect.

<h2>What is VPS and their advantages</h2>

Virtual private servers are servers that are in a remote location (cloud).  Internet service providers usually offer VPS for developers to host their websites without having the hassle of maintaining their own physical server with power source, constant connectivity and stability.  With the VPS, security, constant connectivity, and storage space is all available for you.  Verses a physical server in your garage, you would have to physically add storage of bandwidth if your current system is outdated.

<h2>Why shouldn't you work on the root directory</h2>

There are conflicting information in my findings.  I think some proficient linux/unix users (old timers), do use the root directory for some of their task.  I don't think it's a good idea, especially for us beginners to be using the root directory for any task because it can cause major headaches if we do something wrong, it could allow virus, or others to destroy your system if not careful.  It's mostly to prevent people from make unrepairable mistakes and a big security issue.
